/**
 * Performance and installability reports.
 *
 * Two halves that answer two different questions, stored together because a
 * merchant reads them as one verdict on "is my app any good".
 *
 *   Lighthouse   Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO, measured
 *                by Google's PageSpeed Insights on the live storefront. This
 *                app cannot run Lighthouse itself — that needs a headless
 *                browser, which is a different deployment than "copy the repo,
 *                run node" — so it asks the service that already does.
 *
 *   PWA score    Ours, not Google's, and labelled as ours in the admin. It is a
 *                count of the installability conditions this app is actually
 *                responsible for, checked against the live storefront: is the
 *                manifest reachable through the proxy, does it carry the icons
 *                Chrome insists on, is the theme app embed on the page at all.
 *                Lighthouse dropped its own PWA category in 2024, so there is
 *                nothing left to defer to here.
 *
 * Reports are kept per shop in one JSON file, newest first, capped — see
 * MAX_REPORTS. They are a history a merchant scrolls, not a dataset.
